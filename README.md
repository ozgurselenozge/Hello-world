# Hello-world

Hello!

I am a new participant of GitHub, as you can understand from the file name. My name is Özge, and I am studying electrical and electronic engineering at METU (Middle East Technical University). I am also a quidditch player, playing for METU Unicorns. This game is one of my greatest pleasures. I think that's enough. I'm glad you read these sentences.
